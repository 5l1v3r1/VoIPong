		VOIPONG ALGORITHMS


 Following release 2.0, voipong has started to provide a framework where the
user will be able to select the algorithm that will be used for a network.
This will hopefully enable the user to select the best algorithm to suit his
VoIP infrastructure, so that many more calls can be detected.

There are two currently active algorithms:

1. LFP (Least False Positive) Algorithm:
----------------------------------------

This algorithm tries to detect calls generated via VoIP devices conforming to
RTP and RTCP RFCs. This algorithm should be able to detect and record a wide
range of calls (about 70 % - 80 %).

To use this algorithm, you'll need to specify a network to use with it in your
voipongnets configuration file. 

	E.g.:
	172.16.1.0/255.255.255.0	lfp


2. FIXED (Fixed Port) Algorithm:
--------------------------------

Some VoIP devices (e.g. Grand Stream IP phone adapters) use a fixed port to
send and receive RTP packets, and they do not conform to RFCs. If you have
such a device, you'll need to specify it in your voipongnets file:

	E.g.:
	172.16.1.101/255.255.255.255	fixed	40000

The number next to "fixed" keyword specifies the fixed port number the device
uses for RTP transportation.


3. LRA-SIP (Least Run Away - SIP) Algorithm:
--------------------------------------------

This algo will follow SIP signalling packets, and will spot the RTP/RTCP session 
from the SDP packets.

LRA-SIP is not implemented yet, however I'll be working on it for the
next release (probably 2.1).
