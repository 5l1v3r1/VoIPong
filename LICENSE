	Murat Balaban retains copyright to VoIPong as a whole (including, but not
	limited to, call catching algorithms), and therefore can grant, at his sole

	create proprietary or Open Source (but non-GPL'd) modules which may be 
	dynamically linked at runtime or statically linked at compile time with the 
	portions of VoIPong which fall under his copyright umbrella, or are 
	distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

	If you want to use my code in your GPL'd programs, go for it -- there is no
	requirement that you provide the same exemption in your GPL'd products
	(although if you've written a module for VoIPong I would strongly encourage
	you to make the same exemption that I do).
