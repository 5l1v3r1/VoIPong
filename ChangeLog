-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 BETA [Last Update: Sun Nov 20 15:38:46 EET 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Introduced a framework, where specific algorithms can be specified based on
   CIDR addresses for perfect packet matching. This results in much more
   specialized call catching. Thus a configuration file will be used 
   for the "netaddr - algorithm" specifications (voipongnets).

 - Introduced DSOM (Dynamic Shared Object Module) codec subsystem.
   Beginning with this release, voice codecs will no longer be linked
   statically into the voipong executable. Instead, Voice codecs
   (vocoders) will be compiled as seperate dynamic shared objects (.so). 
   VoIPong will search those modules in its module directory and
   load them at runtime during server initialization.

 - Introduced "LFP" (Least False Positive) algorithm which was the only packet
   matcher in 1.1 as the default algorithm.

 - Introduced "FIXED" algorithm for situations where endpoints do not
   conform to RTP/RTCP RFCs and, do not send RTCP packets.
   If your endpoints do not do signalling but send RTP packets to a fixed
   UDP port, then you can use this algorithm.

 - A newly authored User's Manual available in .html and .sgml forms.

 - PCMU codec has been re-desgined and re-written.

 - Introduced voipctl command to connect to management console.

 - Security improvement: Management console is no longer bound to a 
   TCP port, instead it's now bound to a UNIX domain socket.

 - Introduced a CDR log file (CSV style). All call summaries will be logged here.

 - G711 PCMA support has been added.

 - Output .Wav files can now be mixed for a single .Wav file. (via soxmix)

 - Startup filters can now be specified.

 - Improved packet demultiplexer

 - Improved output .WAV voice quality

 - Many bugfixes, performance improvements and clean-ups in RTP code

 - Improved job handling

 - Improved hash function

 - Management Console changes:
   - calllist command renamed to shcall
   - killsession command renamed to killcall
   - new command: shrtcp, which shows RTCP cache
   - new command: loadnets, to reload network-algorithm matching table
   - new command: setmixflag, to set mixflag
     This command will enable you to specify new network/algorithm matchings
     without restarting voipong.

 - voipong.conf, voipongnets will be copied to /usr/local/etc/voipong
   directory

 - fixed bug: avoid .WAV file creation for empty .RAW files

 - fixed bug: killsession bug

 - fixed bug: proper clean-ups are now done after sniffing worker process
   finishes up.
