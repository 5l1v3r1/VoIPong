			VoIPong TODO

* Implement "algorithm SIP" (a.k.a. algorithm lra) , 
  where VoIPong will trace SIP signalling and catch calls 
  out of SDP packets.

* VoIPong Distributed: 
  Redesign and code call recording so that it can be done in a
  distributed manner

* Collect call statistics out of RTP/RTCP packets.

* Better Cisco Skinny support (i.e. extract phone numbers)

* G726 codec support
  Investigate further: Ignecio's mail

* G723.1 codec support
