			EnderUNIX VoIPong 2.0 INSTALL

The program is tested on 
	- FreeBSD 5.4
	- Solaris 8
	- istanbulX GNU/Linux


[1] Prerequisites
	a) You should have libpcap packet capturing library installed
	b) For .WAV file creation, you should install sox program
	   and supply sox and soxmix path in voipong.conf configuration file.

To compile VoIPong:

There are several pre-written Makefiles in the source directory. Examine each of 
them and choose the one which most suits your system. If you're running of the
the BSD type Operating Systems (i.e. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OSX) copy
Makefile.bsd as Makefile; if you're using a Linux distribution then, copy
Makefile.linux as Makefile. You might need to change CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables
accordingly.

After you've chosen the Makefile and copied it, type make to compile VoIPong:

# make

To install the compiled binaries, type:

# make install 

and binaries will be installed at /usr/local/bin/, the configuration 
file will be installed as /usr/local/etc/voipong.conf, and the algorithm 
specification file as /usr/local/etc/voipongnets.

You're done. All you need to edit the configuration file, change
soxpath and device parameters to suit your system and fire voipong

$ voipong

You can connect to mgmt interface and control your server from the
interface. Use voipctl command for this purpose:

mb@efe ~$ voipctl
Connected to /var/run/voipongmgmt.sock.
